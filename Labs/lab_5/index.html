      <h1>Karan Shah</h1>
        
      <p>An only child born in Mumbai, India. At an age of 5, my father (Pragnesh Shah) came to America alone in pursuit for a better job in computer engineering. A year later, me and my mother (Purvi Shah) finally moved to America to live with my Father. Since then me and my parents have lived in America. We have made many good friends and this country has taught us how to work hard which India does not teach. However, I do still really miss it in Mumbai. I would go every 2-3 years to visit all my family members. I hate reading and writing but I would love to read fiction books. Some of my favorite books are the Harry Potter Series, the Percy Jackson Series and The Secret Garden. You can find the rest of the information about me in the education and stories section.
